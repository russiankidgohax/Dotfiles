### How to use the neovim configuration

- Install lunarvim.
- Clone the lunarvim config into the configuration folder in .config/lvim, typically under the repo <username> in unix-based os'.
- Replace the original config.lua with this one and add all the elements of this repo to the same lvim folder(not in a sub folder like git clone does by default).

### Enjoy some coffee!
You are done installing.
